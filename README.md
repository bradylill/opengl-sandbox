# opengl-sandbox

An attempt to better understand OpenGL via Clojure.

This project currently uses a dependency `[lwjgl/lwjgl "3.0-02-14"]` which is currently living in a local repo. Once
things get going I might put something on Clojars. The lwjgl jar was built using [Roger Allen's instructions](https://github.com/rogerallen/hello_lwjgl)
